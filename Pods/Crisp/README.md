## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Crisp into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Crisp'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Crisp into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "crisp-im/crisp-sdk-ios"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Crisp.framework` into your Xcode project.


## Requirements

⚠️ Adding Camera and Photo permissions is mandatory, `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in  `Info.plist`, to inform your users that you need to access to the Camera and Photo Library. You also have to enable **"iCloud Documents"** capability

## Usage

Start using Crisp by adding the following code on your AppDelegate :

```Swift
import Crisp
Crisp.initialize(websiteId: "YOUR_WEBSITE_ID")
```

### Chatbox

You can add the Crisp bubble by adding in your view `CrispButton()` :

```Swift
import UIKit
import Crisp

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let crispView = CrispView()
        crispView.bounds = view.bounds
        crispView.center = view.center

        view.addSubview(crispView)
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    }
}

```
